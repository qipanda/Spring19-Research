Storybase: Towards Building a Knowledge Base for News Events\
Accessed as paper referencing 2013 O'Connor

# Summary
Created a news event knowledge base called Storybase based on Wikipedia current
events portal. Beyond the creation of this knowledge base, also showed new approaches
for event clustering and chaining.

# Misc. keywords
- *event* is something that happens at a certain place and time (set of news articles
    based on the same news report)
- *storyline* is defined as a coherent sequence of events belonging to a news "story"
- *chaining* links an event to an existing story or if it is the start of a new one

# Skim notes
- To account for different wikipedia users categorical naming, used edit dist and
    jacc. sim to filter down to 12 categories
- To account for more stories (since wikipedia only covers a select few) also 
    crawled daily news articles provided by GDELT project (Leetaru and Schrodt, 2013)
- Events are mapped to one of the 12 categories and events that don't belond to
    a story they are labelled with KNN based on event description
- Events are encoded as a vector containing named entities and locations, NER
    is done with CoreNLP and CAMEO dictionaries as backup -> binary encoding?
- Event space vectors are hashed for fast similarity comparison and are clustered
    together if their hamming dist is within some threshold $\theta$
- Event chaing is investigated with Connecting-Dots coherence score (Shahaf and Guestrin, 2010)
    and KL-divergence
