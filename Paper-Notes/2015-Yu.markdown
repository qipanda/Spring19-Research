Combining Word Embeddings and Feature Embeddings for Fine-grained Relation Extraction
To find good ways of combining source-receiver embeddings

# Summary

# Misc. keywords
- FCM - Factor-based Compositional Embedding Models (cross-product of features 
    with embedding values to get total feature set)

# Skim notes
- Hand crafted features and word embeddings should be combined for NLP tasks, 
    one reason might be that things like long term dependencies can easily be
    captured by hand-crafted features but not so much with embeddings
- Previous attempts to combine such features resulted in an exponential increase
    in the count of features
- Their method builds off of Yu et al (2014)'s Factor-based Compositional
    Embedding Models (FCM) and
