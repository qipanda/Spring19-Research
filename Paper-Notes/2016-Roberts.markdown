Navigating the Local Modes of Big Data: The Case of Topic Models\
Accessed as paper referencing 2013 O'Connor

# Summary
Describes the situation of multi-modality in the context of topic models and 
strategies to apply them to practical problems.

# Misc. keywords
- LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) - topic model using patterns of word co-occurrences
    to discover latent themes across documents

# Skim notes
- Discusses techniques to deal with multi-modality -> class of topic models which
    have non-convex optimization problems
- Multi-modality issue may arrise later... for now not relevant
